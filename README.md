# Face Recognition Login System

Welcome to our Face Recognition Login Program GitHub repository!

Our program utilizes state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to authenticate users and grant them access to their accounts. By simply looking into the camera, users can securely log in without the need for passwords or PINs.

Our code is built with Python and utilizes OpenCV and Dlib libraries for face detection and recognition. We also provide a simple user interface for easy integration into your existing applications.

Join us in creating a more secure and convenient way for users to access their accounts. Feel free to contribute and make our program even better!
